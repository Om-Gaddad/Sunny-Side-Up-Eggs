Steps:

1: Take out a Non-Stick Pan, and begin to heat it up. Let it heat up for about 1 minute.
2: Add butter on the pan. There is no specific amount needed, but add enogh that the center areas are lightly coated with butter. Too little might make it harder to remove off the pan, while too much will affect the taste.
3: Crack your egg, and place the yolk and whites on the pan. Now, let it cook for about 2 minutes. If you think it's ready at about 1:30 minutes, you can move to the next step. Leaving it for too long will make it stick to the pan, but too little will make it raw.
4: Add the Salt. After that, add about as much Pepper and Garlic and Herbs you wish!
5: After letting it cook for a little bit, take it off and place it on a plate.
6: If you wish you may toast a bread and place it under the egg. This will add a base, and increase the taste. You can also pour some orange juice if you are not in a rush. In fact, any form of juice is fine!
7: Enjoy you meal!
